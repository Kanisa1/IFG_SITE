                <h2>Our Background </h2>
                <p>Our initiative to start this organization was inspired by updated data from literatures showing continuous increase of unintended teen pregnancies where some ends into unsafe abortions, Sexually Transmitted Diseases including HIV and related mental health problems in Rwandan youth generations. As healthcare professionals, we thought of contributing to fight against all these problems by transforming Rwandan youth informed decision makers about their sexual reproductive health and rights , HIV/AIDS and mental health and promotion of youths who already affected to save our future generations, the people of today and tomorrow for the sustainable development of our country. Our organization endeavors to contribute towards Rwanda’s sustainable development, through achieving its goal of the “The Rwanda we want” of vision 2050, as it is stated in the first pillar of human development specifically on universal access to high quality health care. <BR> <BR>
